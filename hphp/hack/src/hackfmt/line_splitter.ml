    (* FIXME: This is a hack to work around the bizarre situation we're in,
     * where chunks are associated with the newline preceding them (because Bob
     * Nystrom suggested that that approach might be nicer than the
     * alternative), but chunk ranges associate tokens with the newline that
     * followed them (since that newline is in the token's trailing trivia).
     * Because chunks are associated with the split preceding them, printing a
     * range of chunks produces a newline before and not after. However, the
     * range we were provided associates newline characters with the line
     * preceding them, so the caller expects a newline after and not before. *)
