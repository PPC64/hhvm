 * There was a bug in the typechecker, and this flag exists PURELY to facilitate
 * migration away from the bug. It is safe to remove thereafter. Here's the bug:
 *
 * Consider a shape A and shape B. In this example, we're trying to use shape A
 * as a supertype of shape B.
 *
 * When this is disabled, we only verify that supertype shape A's fields are
 * consistent with subtype shape B's fields. So, consider:
 *
 * type A = shape('int_field' => int);
 * type B = shape('int_field' => int, ?'optional_string_field' => string);
 *
 * Here, A has a single field. It is in fact consistent with B's definition!
 * However, since A is a FieldsFullyKnown shape, it has the additional
 * requirement that no other fields may be present in the subtype shape B. Here,
 * 'optional_string_field' may be present in B, and so A should not be a
 * supertype of B. When this flag is enabled, this relationship is enforced.
