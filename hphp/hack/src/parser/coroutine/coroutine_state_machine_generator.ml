(*
Consider a coroutine such as
coroutine function foo() : void {
  suspend blah();
  suspend blah();
}

There is an implicit "return;" at the end, and we'll need to rewrite this as

function foo_rewritten(...) : CoroutineResult<Unit> {
   ...
   $closure->label = -1;
   return new ActualCoroutineResult(coroutine_unit());
   ...
}

However we can avoid introducing the extra return if the end point of the
method is unreachable. A method which already ends with a return or throw
has an unreachable endpoint, so there would be no way to reach the
introduced return.

As a small optimization we avoid generating the extra return if we know that
the method endpoint is reachable.

TODO: Is this optimization reasonable? We could simply generate it always.
It doesn't add that much extra code.
